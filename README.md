Attached is the code for task1 and task2 respectively

Task 1

Dataset is first loaded and examined, followed by basic EDA to identify hidden features. After this, various plots are used to illustrate hidden patterns and answer questions about the factors affecting student life and performance.
Dataset is then modified for training. Two models, using logistic regression and Random forest are trained on this data to make predictions.

Task 2

The Chatbot present here consists of an llm node(Gemini), a calculator and a weather function(OpenWeatherMap). They are connected by a routing logic based on regex.
